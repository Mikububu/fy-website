<img src="/blog-images/tantra-group-meditation-circle-cowhide-mat.jpg" alt="Group tantra meditation session on traditional cowhide mat with practitioners in circle formation" title="Tantra group meditation circle - intimate spiritual practice session"/><p>AI white lotus podcast by google LM</p>0:00-12:26<audio>Audio playback is not supported on your browser. Please upgrade.</audio><p><em>At forbidden-yoga.com, we dance at the edge of the forbidden, where yoga meets the untamed passions of the soul. In this realm, the spiritual and sensual merge in a tempestuous embrace, echoing the primal rhythms of life itself.</em></p><p><strong>Private Initiations into the Tantric lineage through Michael Perin Wogenburg - to women only (1-7 days, worldwide, by invitation) </strong></p><img src="/blog-images/michael-perin-tantra-teacher-straw-hat-portrait.jpg" alt="Michael Perin Wogenburg tantra teacher portrait wearing traditional straw hat and striped scarf" title="Michael Perin Wogenburg - Tantric lineage holder and spiritual teacher"/><p>You have a problem that won't resolve. Therapy identified it but can't shift it. Medication doesn't touch it. Standard spiritual practice makes it worse. Professional burnout that's actually spiritual crisis. Depression that resists every xanax. Trauma so deep that talking reinforces the pattern.</p><p>Private initiations are concentrated interventions using practices that exist nowhere in published literature. You reach out. If your issue falls within range, we discuss location and timing. Sometimes you travel to Michael. Sometimes he comes to you. Sometimes we pick a third location.</p><p>Days have no predetermined schedule. Some mornings start before dawn with practices that make ordinary reality unbearably vivid. Some start slow. The work uses breath techniques that restructure energy movement, specific kriyas targeting your exact blockage, direct transmission that can't be described beforehand.</p><p><strong>Online Coaching (when distance makes direct work impossible)</strong></p><img src="/blog-images/kundalini-pranayama-breathing-technique-diagram.jpg" alt="Hand-drawn kundalini pranayama breathing technique diagram showing chakras and energy flow with timing instructions" title="Kundalini pranayama practice guide - 25 second breathing cycle with chakra activation"/><p></p><p>Same guidance, different format. Weekly video sessions. Practices between calls. The techniques come from the same tradition, adapted for remote work.</p><p>You get specific practices calibrated to your situation. You practice between sessions. On calls, we adjust based on what's happening. This continues until the issue resolves or until it becomes clear you need in-person work.</p><p><strong>Sensual Liberation Retreats (10 days to 10 months)</strong></p><img src="/blog-images/sensual-tantra-liberation-intimate-practice.jpg" alt="Sensual tantra liberation retreat showing intimate connection and sacred touch practices between participants" title="Tantra sensual liberation - transformative bodywork and energetic healing"/><p>The most intensive option. Ten days to ten months of immersion in practices most spiritual communities don't acknowledge exist.</p><p>These retreats use paid placeholder actors, carefully selected to match your psychosexual profile. This is why they cost significantly more than typical retreat offerings. You're not paying for accommodation and meals. You're paying for complete customization, professional actors trained in these specific practices, worldwide luxury locations, and absolute privacy.</p><p>The retreats address what therapy and conventional spirituality cannot touch. Professional stagnation. Recovery from devastating breakups. Sexual performance issues. Difficulty attracting sexual partners or finding satisfying, loving relationships. Depression and chronic health problems resistant to treatment.</p><p>You choose duration, location, and participant profiles. Michael designs the specific practices based on your situation. Days include outdoor morning meditations that heighten sensory perception. Body-based practices that work at metaphysical levels. Some exercises performed nude, in close proximity, designed to elicit bliss while facilitating deep transformation. Taoist sensual massage. Shadow gazing. Kriyas from extinct lineages.</p><p><strong>Group Retreats (rare, announced when timing serves the work)</strong></p><img src="/blog-images/balinese-tantra-ceremony-space-candles.jpg" alt="Balinese tantra ceremony space with golden deity statues meditation cushions and candlelight altar" title="Sacred tantra ceremony room in Bali - traditional spiritual practice space"/><img src="/blog-images/balinese-deity-statue-candlelight-ritual.jpg" alt="Balinese deity statue surrounded by candles during evening tantra ritual ceremony" title="Balinese goddess statue at candlelit tantra ritual - sacred feminine worship"/><p>Occasionally we offer group retreats when specific practices benefit from group dynamics. These happen infrequently, announced only when the timing serves the work.</p><p>If conventional approaches have failed and you know it, reach out.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ❤️ or if you just love our work 🫶 we would love to hear from you 🫠</p><p>love@forbidden-yoga.com</p>
