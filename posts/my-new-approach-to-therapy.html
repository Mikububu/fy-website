            <div><p>Michael Perin Wogenburg is the protector of an ancient, esoteric spiritual tradition stemming from the left-hand path of Tantra. Spirituality, art, the mystical, and the occult have always been a fascination for Michael, beginning in his early childhood in Villach, Austria. In 1995, together with his wife Stefanie, Michael created an interactive media design company- Science Wonder Productions. He ended his career in media design after the loss of his wife and second child in child labor, and redirected his passion into locating therapeutic methods to work through the state of shock and trauma he found himself in. Frustrated with the inefficiency of his findings, Michael began studying and developing an interdisciplinary system for working with trauma. He longed for techniques that would help him on his recovery journey, but would also inspire him creatively and reconnect him with the magical, awe-filled experience of his childhood.</p><p>Unimpressed with his findings and desperate for his own healing, he began studying and experimenting with several therapeutic modalities. Michael inherited teachings from an ancient line of Tantric gurus which integrated with elements of performance theatre, psychoanalysis, animist rituals, and other psycho-ritual methods of healing. The cornerstone of Michael’s offerings is the Sensual Liberation Retreat, a one to four-week program uniquely curated to meet the needs and desires of each participant.</p><p>love@Forbidden-yoga.com</p></div>
