Originating from a lineage of women dedicated to achieving immortality through the cultivation and transformation of male sexual energy, the teachings are neither feminist nor vampiric, as is often misunderstood.</p><div class="videoScrollTarget-SzB20Y" data-component-name="VideoEmbedPlayer" id="media-aec99b29-0360-4ef7-b1c0-c6aa12d897ea"><div class="container-ODcHQE videoPlaceholderSilhouette-XopYyA containerAnimated-jVAZvQ"></div></div><p>Rather, they stem from a profound philosophical and spiritual tradition. As stated in the White Tigress Manual: 'Sex is like a poison, and like most poisons, it is also its own antidote. Tigresses are not emotionally attached to sex; we see it as a powerful vehicle to restore and enhance physical beauty and delve into the sublime Tao to attain immortality' (p. 45).</p><p>Hsi Lai, an American scholar and practitioner, brought these ancient practices to light in his 2001 book "The Sexual Teachings of the White Tigress," making them accessible to a Western audience for the first time. The text explores the secretive tradition of the White Tigress, a path followed by women in China who sought spiritual enlightenment and longevity through the disciplined cultivation of sexual energy. As Lai describes, these women 'undertake disciplined sexual and spiritual practices to restore their beauty and youthfulness, realizing their full feminine potential and the condition of an immortaless' (p. 23). Their training begins in early adulthood, involving rigorous practices such as meditation, specialized diets, physical exercises, and specific sexual techniques designed to transform sexual essence, or "jing," into spiritual energy, known as "shen."</p><p>Within this tradition, male partners are categorized as 'Green Dragons' or 'Jade Dragons.' A Green Dragon is a man whose 'fresh energy revitalizes the Tigress, primarily through oral practices. By ingesting semen, considered a potent life force, the Tigress rejuvenates her body, maintains youthfulness, and deepens her spiritual practice' (p. 68). Conversely, a Jade Dragon is a man who practices semen retention during intimacy, ensuring a 'mutual exchange of energies that benefits both partners in their spiritual progression' (p. 69). This dichotomy emphasizes the different methods of energy cultivation between men and women, highlighting the mutual respect and spiritual growth central to the practice.</p><div class="videoScrollTarget-SzB20Y" data-component-name="VideoEmbedPlayer" id="media-420c75b3-26d7-4144-be99-3d1f679d36bb"><div class="container-ODcHQE videoPlaceholderSilhouette-XopYyA containerAnimated-jVAZvQ"></div></div><p></p><p>The White Tigress tradition operates under strict ethical guidelines, emphasizing the well-being of both partners. As Lai points out, 'A true White Tigress would never exploit or harm her male partners; her practices are about achieving harmony and balance, integrating physical vitality with spiritual growth' (p. 89). The women are careful to follow the tenets of respect and consent, contrary to their often vampiric depictions in literature and art. 'Our past avenues for propagation of the teachings have disappeared very rapidly in this century, so the options for preserving the teachings cannot exist as they have in the past,' writes Madame Lin, a modern-day adherent and teacher, further elucidating the challenges faced by practitioners (p. 102).</p><p>Geographically, these traditions were practiced in certain regions of China, though their exact locations remain obscure due to their secretive nature. As Lai details, 'Knowledge was often transmitted orally or through hidden manuscripts to protect it from external scrutiny and potential persecution' (p. 115). Political upheavals such as the rise of communism and the Cultural Revolution led to the suppression of many traditional practices, including those of the White Tigress. These esoteric teachings were seen as incompatible with socialist ideals, driving them underground and threatening their survival.</p><p>Lai's work has been instrumental in documenting and preserving these endangered teachings. His subsequent book, "The Sexual Teachings of the Jade Dragon" (2003), focuses on the male aspect of Taoist sexual cultivation. As Lai writes, 'Jade Dragons must learn to harness their sexual energy, practicing techniques such as semen retention, breath control, and meditation to convert sexual essence into life force and spiritual energy' (p. 42). These methods are not merely about physical control but represent a deeper ethical engagement with one's partner, ensuring mutual respect and spiritual advancement.</p><p>Exploring both the White Tigress and Jade Dragon traditions provides a comprehensive view of how sexual energy is harnessed and transformed within Taoist practices. As Lai eloquently states, 'These teachings challenge Western ideas of sexuality by positioning it not merely as a biological function but as a potent force for spiritual transformation' (p. 101). His works emphasize the importance of disciplined cultivation, ethical conduct, and the integration of physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines. Unlike in India, where texts on left-hand tantric traditions (Vamachara) are rare and often inaccessible due to cultural taboos, these Chinese works offer accessible information on similar spiritual paths.</p><p>'The Tigress must put forth great effort, and to experience nine separate illuminations in three years is not easy. Few Tigresses can achieve it, just as few Taoist males ever achieve creating their spiritual fetus,' writes Lai, emphasizing the arduous nature of these practices (p. 152). Both traditions highlight the connection between sexuality and spirituality, underscoring the transformative potential of disciplined practice.</p><p>By documenting these esoteric traditions, Lai has opened new avenues for those interested in alternative methods of personal development and spiritual growth. His works contribute to a broader understanding of Eastern philosophies, revealing how sexuality and spirituality intertwine in complex ways. As he concludes, 'Only by shedding our preconceptions and approaching these texts with genuine curiosity can we grasp the profound wisdom they offer' (p. 176).</p><p>To fully appreciate these teachings, one must approach them with cultural sensitivity and an understanding of their historical context. As Lai notes, 'The practices were developed in a specific time and place, influenced by the social, political, and spiritual landscapes of ancient China. The political turmoil of the 20th century threatened their survival, making their documentation even more critical' (p. 200). Hsi Lai's work serves as a bridge between ancient wisdom and modern curiosity, inviting a deeper exploration of how these practices can contribute to personal empowerment, health, and spiritual enlightenment.</p><p><strong>Integrating the Jade Dragon Teachings</strong></p><p>In "The Sexual Teachings of the Jade Dragon," Hsi Lai delves into the male counterpart of the White Tigress tradition, exploring the intricate practices of male sexual cultivation and revitalization. The Jade Dragon, as Lai describes, is not merely a passive participant but an active co-practitioner in this dual spiritual journey. His role involves harnessing, transforming, and ultimately elevating his sexual energy or "ching" to achieve spiritual enlightenment, health, and longevity.</p><p>Lai outlines how the Jade Dragon undergoes various practices, such as semen retention, internal alchemy, and physical exercises designed to refine and control his sexual energy. The concept of "reverting ching to the brain" is central, where 'the male must learn to circulate his conserved energy throughout the body, directing it upwards to nourish the brain and spirit, thereby achieving a state of heightened awareness and spiritual vitality' (p. 72). This technique is not simply a physical exercise but a profound spiritual discipline, reflecting the Taoist belief in the interdependence of physical and spiritual health.</p><p>The Jade Dragon's journey begins with mastering control over his sexual impulses. As Lai explains, 'the constant dissipation of semen leads only to old age, sickness, and death. A man's ching is the basis of his physical health, and to haphazardly and frequently dissipate it is to throw his health away' (p. 104). Through practices like "Gazing at the Green Dragon," a form of intense visual meditation that uses voyeuristic experiences to stimulate and internalize sexual energy, the Jade Dragon is trained to 'observe without attachment, to desire without consumption, and to transform lust into spiritual fuel' (p. 125).</p><p>These methods, though seemingly unconventional, serve a deeper purpose within Taoist practice. The Jade Dragon must learn to balance the 'three treasures'—ching (sexual energy), qi (vital force), and shen (spirit or consciousness). As the text reveals, 'the greater the ching, the more abundant the qi, and the stronger the shen becomes' (p. 139). This triadic balance is essential for achieving both physical rejuvenation and spiritual immortality.</p><p>While the White Tigress seeks male partners to enhance her spiritual growth, the Jade Dragon's practices are fundamentally about self-mastery and personal transformation. His training includes techniques for enhancing sexual prowess, such as the "Nine Jade Dragon Exercises," which encompass a series of movements and breath control practices aimed at cultivating strength, flexibility, and the efficient circulation of qi throughout the body (p. 88).</p><p>One notable practice involves "Dragon Twists Pillar," where the Jade Dragon performs a series of controlled muscle contractions and visualizations while gazing at his White Tigress, or through other means, to stimulate the energy flow along his spine and towards his brain. This exercise is part of the broader discipline of "Opening the Original Cavity," which is critical for achieving the Yellow Stream, an advanced spiritual state characterized by heightened mental clarity and physical vitality (p. 167).</p><p>The role of the Jade Dragon is not just about individual cultivation but also about forming a balanced, harmonious relationship with the White Tigress. The partnership is governed by mutual respect, clearly defined boundaries, and ethical guidelines. Lai emphasizes that 'the Jade Dragon must be void of jealousy, attachment, and lack of discipline while maintaining an intense sexual-spiritual relationship with the White Tigress' (p. 113). This balance is difficult to achieve, and only those deeply committed to the Taoist path can fully embrace it.</p><p>Moreover, the text highlights the critical interplay between celibacy and sexual activity in these practices. As Lai points out, 'both celibacy and sexual overindulgence dissipate the ching at an accelerated rate. The path of the Jade Dragon involves a careful navigation between these extremes, using sexual energy not merely for pleasure but as a means to cultivate longevity and spiritual illumination' (p. 192). The Jade Dragon practices reflect a profound understanding of human sexuality, where energy is preserved, refined, and directed towards higher spiritual goals.</p><p>Through this integration, Lai provides a unique perspective on male Taoist practices, revealing the deep philosophical and spiritual insights underlying these ancient traditions. His work invites a broader audience to reconsider the role of sexual energy in personal development and spiritual growth. As the text concludes, 'To be a Jade Dragon is to embark on a journey where the body becomes a vessel for divine energy, the mind a field for enlightenment, and life itself a practice in the art of balancing desire and restraint' (p. 204).</p><p><strong>Why Forbidden Yoga Publishes This</strong></p><p>Are we doing similar practices? Yes. And no.</p><p>In Forbidden Yoga, we don’t work under Indian logic. Indians would call what we’re after moksha - liberation from rebirth. But I think the Chinese have a better take on the subject. Because it’s all about accumulating and transforming sexual energy in this lifetime.</p><p>The Chinese Taoist texts, particularly Hsi Lai’s “Sexual Teachings of the White Tigress” and “Sexual Teachings of the Jade Dragon,” describe the mechanics of sexual energy cultivation with a clarity that Indian Tantric literature never achieved in writing. </p><p>We work with similar dynamics in Forbidden Yoga, but we’re not working with semen directly. The effect - the danger and the great potentiality - is very similar. But we’ve adapted the technology for contemporary bodies and contexts.</p><p>There are no Indian books that describe this as clearly as the Chinese texts. The knowledge either stayed oral, got suppressed, or was lost. What we offer in Forbidden Yoga comes from what survived in transmission and practice.</p><p>If you’re a woman who wants access to this immense sexual potentiality, you can get in touch with us. If you’re a man with such a woman as your partner, and you want to try this kind of practice - knowing she holds the power - you may consider reaching out.</p><p>love@forbidden-yoga.com</p><p></p></div>
