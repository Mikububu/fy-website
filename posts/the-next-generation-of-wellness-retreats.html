Here is a man living between that which is seen and unseen, to be found in a jungle in Africa, a beach in Costa Rica, or a mountain in Nepal. Someone who has dedicated himself to collecting and preserving the lost ancient practices of Indian spirituality. The sacred and lost narratives of being. To say that the work, the service, of this man is complex, is an understatement. How do we break down a Forbidden Yoga Retreat? Where each detail has gone to such depths that the experience will change like the breeze you find on your skin as you sit in morning Sadhana, naked, vulnerable, in bliss or in chaos. As your senses are heightened by sound, by scent, by light, by thought, by the life-affirming sounds of nature, as audible as the earth&#8217;s breath.</p><p>We can say that Michael is a wellness disruptor. These methodologies are not cut-and-paste. They take time and research and understanding to curate possibilities for clients seeking more than the norm. When one reaches somehow immovable life challenges, people are willing to step outside of their comfort zone. Michael will challenge your values, your goals, your dreams. He will facilitate this journey described by himself as cinemagraphic. &#8220;We do not manifest abundance here,&#8221; Michael says, &#8220;you are already loaded enough. We manifest the supernatural to touch you. This is your personal interstellar movie. Walk into the irrational!&#8221; Michael explains that the seemingly bizarre or absurd techniques employed in Tantric Laya Yoga are profoundly effective at expanding consciousness and enhancing locked-up dimensions of consciousness.</p><p>Michael is likened to the &#8216;Indiana Jones&#8217; of mystical spirituality, someone who explores unknown territories and recovers precious spiritual artifacts, bringing them back to those who seek enlightenment in modern times. &#8220;I work without any visible structure. Some people may say my work is chaotic, but the only thing I do is mirror the participants&#8217; own chaos. My &#8216;spa menu&#8217; is my client&#8217;s subconscious.&#8221; Michael says. Is this where we take the future of luxury wellness? Total individualization, customization of clients&#8217; needs without pandering to anyone? Facilitating real needs as opposed to what the ego desires? Not an easy bridge to cross and certainly not something easily replicated. This makes this modality all the rarer and more precious.</p><p>Michael&#8217;s vision of luxury wellness transcends the superficial&#8212;beyond the quality of toothpaste in a deluxe bungalow or discussing trauma bonds in thermal sessions and cacao ceremonies. His philosophy centres on the depth and quality of spiritual, psychological, and somatic practices offered beyond a conventional retreat centre menu.</p><p>Michael reflects on the broader trend within the luxury wellness industry, where ancient spiritual practices are often imported and integrated into Western luxury retreat centres. Repackaged for modern audiences seeking exotic and transformative experiences. He cautions to be mindful of the fine line between cultural appropriation and what he describes as a neo-colonial attitude, where these ancient practices are adopted not merely as cultural appropriation but as a form of spiritual domination, reshaping them in ways that may strip them of their original context and depth.</p><p>He acknowledges the complexity of these issues, admitting that while it may be challenging to change these industry-wide practices, it is crucial for those within the wellness sector to remain vigilant and conscientious about how these ancient traditions are treated, represented, and respected.</p><p>To illustrate this point, Michael mentions the poignant film &#8216;Embrace of the Serpent,&#8217; which explores themes of cultural and spiritual exchange, highlighting the delicate balance between learning from, and exploiting indigenous traditions. He describes the film&#8217;s plot, where an anthropologist initially appears to be studying ancient medicinal practices for academic purposes, but is revealed to have been sent by a pharmaceutical company with the goal of exploiting these same traditions for profit, a narrative that echoes the complexities Michael discusses.</p><p>Michael brings up Peter Brook&#8217;s theatrical adaptation of the Mahabharata, which was notable for its deliberate casting choices, involving American, African, and Indian actors to retell this pivotal Indian spiritual epic, providing a unique perspective on how cultural narratives can be shared across different cultural backgrounds. He concludes this part of the discussion by suggesting that when done thoughtfully and consciously, what often is critiqued as cultural appropriation can instead become an enriching adventure that broadens understanding and appreciation among diverse audiences.</p><p>You can feel the deep intimacy that is required for personal transformation. Michael&#8217;s retreats attract mainly individuals and couples seeking personal growth, and healing. What are the main drivers that motivate and inspire people to seek Michael&#8217;s work?</p><ul><li><p>Destructive life patterns and habits</p></li><li><p>PTSD &#8211; Trauma</p></li><li><p>Relationship issues</p></li><li><p>Addictions</p></li><li><p>Anhedonia &#8211; the inability to experience joy or pleasure/lack of happiness</p></li><li><p>Depression</p></li><li><p>Anxiety</p></li><li><p>BDD &#8211; Body Dysmorphic Disorder</p></li><li><p>Low self-esteem / lack of confidence</p></li><li><p>Those seeking freedom from &#8220;dis-ease&#8221; or illness</p></li><li><p>Sexual dysfunction</p></li></ul><p>Michael treats participants who have issues that interfere with their ability to function normally. Michael says that extreme behaviours require an &#8220;unlearning&#8221; process. Many participants are high net worth, very successful, high performing individuals who lack balance and clarity in their personal lives and have a desire for spiritual fulfilment. These are people who may have tried out so many options, and nothing has worked. The retreat may not always be a fun process. There is nothing &#8220;sugar coated.&#8221; Finding solutions can be invasive. Participants need to be prepared to dig deep, and trust in the process. The Indian Mahavidya Goddess Kali&#8217;s energy brings about the unhinged truths, about their lives&#8217; and the karmic options available says Michael. Like the Indian God Ganesh, (remover of obstacles and with the ability to move situations swiftly onwards), Goddess Kali requires radical solutions leading to quick changes. Continuing he says, &#8220;I delve deeper into people&#8217;s karmic constellations.&#8221; To note, Michael taps into a very Asian model of work as opposed to traditional Western coaching mindset. The Philosophy of Taoism, Zen and Hindu religions are the perspectives he utilizes and resonates with most. He is not telling participants what to do. He does not advise, but facilitates personal growth and empowerment, through the very complex landscape of tailored ancient spiritual practice. These are lost rites and rituals that have been taught to Michael by gurus and masters. He expresses a challenge he has faced, despite his efforts to consult with gurus and scholarly experts to gain deeper insights into these practices, Michael has found that few are able to trace the origins or fully grasp the profound meanings embedded within these ancient techniques. Michael also collaborates with a team that includes medical doctors, and psychoanalysts, seers and healers.</p><p>The cinemagraphic nature of the retreats can be found in the environment and location that has been curated but also in the &#8220;actors&#8221; that Michael carefully sources, from any relevant global locations. Called &#8220;placeholders&#8221; these actors are reminiscent of those of director David Fincher&#8217;s movie &#8220;The Game.&#8221; This theatrical troupe are there for the process of working one on one with the individual, assisting with various activities, asanas, sadhanas, rites, roleplays, and rituals. There is always a private chef on retreat. Michael says he is always looking for amazing &#8220;out of the box&#8221; chefs, he often meets in his travels, be they vegan Japanese inspired or raw foods experts, providing all the nutritious life-giving meals.</p><p>Michael&#8217;s retreats are commonly curated for couples and individuals, many are women seeking empowerment, pattern changing from life&#8217;s expectations as mothers, daughters, partners, in the material patriarchy they find themselves in and the generational unlearning that&#8217;s required.</p><p>What would a couple anticipate to experience on their retreat? Will they solve their relationship issues? Michael explains, &#8220;We do not directly fix anything here. We put people into different spaces, different situations, and put their minds into a blissful state connecting them with the source of life, with the absolute reality. Once they can observe their own relationship patterns much better, and know how and where they find real harmony and bliss. Needless to say, we all expect too much from one life partner. We ascend from tribal structures; it would be naive to think one husband can provide for all your needs &#8211; sexual, spiritual, best friend, and provider. It&#8217;s simply impossible. The reason people divorce is not about them. It&#8217;s because the model we created so far as a society just doesn&#8217;t work. You just make it all too personal, starting wars about problems which are much bigger than you can comprehend. What Michael does is open a potential paradise space; you see alternatives to the life you live right now. You feel and experience other options.</p><p>Michael says: &#8220;Don&#8217;t make your relationship the dharma of your life, make spiritual ecstasy the dharma of your life instead! If you experience the deepest fulfilment by being sexually motivated, be conscious about it and live &#8216;this&#8217; dream. If you want to meditate in the midst of nature touching the spirits of the earth, live &#8216;this&#8217; dream. Just be honest with what you really want, don&#8217;t lie to yourself and waste another lifetime! Only with this honesty can we survive as an individual, as a couple, as a family, as one humanity.&#8221;</p><p>Forbidden Yoga clients have the freedom to choose the length of their retreat, the location, and even the participants, (placeholder actors may be required,) ensuring an entirely tailored experience that addresses their individual needs and desires. This level of customization and flexibility allows Michael to create transformative retreats that rejuvenate and empower those who partake in our programs, providing an unparalleled journey of self-discovery and growth.</p><p>What would my day look like on a retreat with Michael Perin Wogenburg, you may ask? Early outdoor morning ancient Bahir Bhuta Dharana meditations designed to heighten your sensory perceptions and deepen your connection to the earth. In the midst of this deep concentration, a sudden, unexpected thought may surface in the mind of one of the participants, emerging unbidden from the depths of their subconscious. Michael explains, &#8220;we welcome these interruptions,&#8221; clarifying that in the left-handed tantric traditions, all thoughts, regardless of their nature, are embraced rather than suppressed, as they are considered essential to personal growth and understanding. He invites the individual to expand their each fleeting thought in the mind and then later, after the meditation, share it, fostering an open dialogue that encourages self-exploration and collective understanding. You are encouraged to amplify your thoughts, to explore their boundaries and potential impact fully. He will encourage you to stretch your mental capacity, to really see the extent of your imagination&#8217;s power, transforming fear into a vivid controlled mental narrative.</p><p>Equally, there could be mindful eating at breakfast or alternatively a day of fasting with fresh juices and medicinal teas.</p><p>Michael Perin Wogenburg is a wellness disruptor with 25 years refining his craft. What he offers is unprecedented and each person will have entirely different experiences based on their own needs. Michael works with high net worth individuals, couples wishing to enrich their relationship, and small groups, addressing issues such as burn-out, generational trauma, anhedonia, (the inability to experience joy or pleasure), sexual inadequacies, grief, anxiety, depression. Expect the unexpected, nudity, sexual tantric practice, yoga practice, confrontational selections, be they environment, foods, the conceptual psyche. Liken your journey to the architect&#8217;s obsession with shadows and light.</p><p>Michael uses a technique called &#8216;conscious spinning,&#8217; a practice where participants actively manipulate their thoughts, spinning them into complex scenarios while remaining fully aware of the process and its implications on their understanding of their own minds. He prompts them to use these isolated thoughts as the basis for crafting detailed, Stephen King-like narratives where their lives spiral into chaos, a creative and cathartic exploration of their deepest fears. This exercise is both a challenge and a test, seeing how effectively they can harness their creativity to articulate these internal landscapes.</p><p>After reaching a peak in their imaginative exertions, Michael guides them to let go of these narratives abruptly and return their focus to their immediate sensory experiences, re-engaging with the sounds, smells, and tactile sensations of the natural world around them. He encourages them to shift their mental focus from internal reflections to external realities, to anchor themselves in the present and the physical space they occupy.</p><p>Michael explains that by deepening their concentration on ambient sounds, they can gradually expand their perceptual range, potentially one day accessing the 'Nadas' - mystical sounds considered in Tantric traditions to be cosmic vibrations stored within nature's metaphysical realms, akin to a celestial library of audio experiences waiting to be accessed by those who are sufficiently attuned. Interestingly enough, we find ourselves in an age where the music of nature is being enhanced by vibrational technology, with measurable frequencies that can be recorded and played back.</p><p>An afternoon session may involve a workshop of creative writing, where participants are encouraged to confront their inhibitions by writing down any action they might find embarrassing or unconventional that they could theoretically undertake today. He challenges them to mentally transgress the boundaries and norms that society has imposed, urging them to rethink what is acceptable and what is not, thereby fostering a mindset that embraces greater freedom and creativity.</p><p>&#8220;Create like a god,&#8221; he suggests, prompting them to use their imaginations to script the most outrageously amusing scenarios for their day, crafting narratives that stretch the limits of their usual day-to-day experiences. He instructs them to begin each sentence with &#8220;Today I will,&#8221; followed by various actions, creating a list of 30 potential activities that explore and expand their sense of personal agency and whimsy. He further encourages them to let go of any inhibitions or self-censorship, to write as if they are dreaming or fantasizing in a drunken state of mind, allowing their entire body to be involved in the flow of creativity, unbound by rational constraints.</p><p>In this exercise, Michael introduces a complex philosophical concept from an extinguished Tantric tradition known as Pratyayasarga Sadhana, which involves the deliberate exaggeration of primary (intrinsic, uncontradicted thoughts,) and secondary, (conflicted, doubt-filled thoughts) into the realm of the absurd, using this technique to explore the mind&#8217;s untapped landscapes. He explains that beyond the realm of ordinary, contradictory secondary thoughts lies the realm of primary thoughts&#8230; pure, undiluted ideas that are free from internal conflict and societal conditioning. &#8220;What do you really want deep down in your psyche?&#8221; he often insists. &#8220;What do you really want? Have no fear to speak it out loud! Only if the primary thought can exist without the secondary, can true manifestation happen. In order to get there, you must kill the &#8216;Vaikrita&#8217;, the secondary thought, by taking it into the realms of comedianish absurdity.&#8221; Michael shares that this philosophical approach is rooted in ancient tantric traditions originating from West Bengal. Traditions that have nearly been lost to time, barely surviving through the ages.</p><p>As they wrap up this exercise, Michael engages with his clients and the actors from his theatre troupe, discussing the outcomes of the speech sadhana practice, analyzing the insights and breakthroughs that have emerged. Despite the depth of the exercises, between laughing and crying and screaming, the atmosphere remains light and often humorous, with the practice taking on a comedic tone as participants share their exaggerated narratives and embrace the absurdity of their creations.</p><p>At dusk, Michael introduces his private clients to an ancient and nearly forgotten practice known as &#8220;Uus,&#8221; the long U of the Sanskrit vocals, a magical extended version of what is today only known by some commercial yoga schools as Candle Trakata. This involves a deeply meditative exercise where participants focus their gaze on the flames emanating from an arranged set of candles, positioned in geometric patterns alongside various symbolic objects. This practice aims to open mystical parts of the brain without the use of psychedelics.</p><p>Michael instructs the group with specific guidelines: &#8220;Arrange the candles so that they form a circle around a central object. Focus all your attention on this central object, allowing the peripheral vision of the candle flames to blur, and eventually seem as though they disappear from your sight.&#8221; This is about altering perception through intense concentration. Following the first exercise, Michael sets up another scenario: four candles are aligned in a straight line with only two lit. He then asks everyone to close their eyes and reverse their earlier perceptions&#8212;imagining that the candles which are lit appear unlit, and those that are unlit appear lit. This practice challenges their mental mapping of reality, pushing them to visualize and manifest changes purely through the power of thought.</p><p>Michael calls the various retreat treatments available as &#8220;side dishes&#8221;. They are curated for each individual retreat, based on practitioner availability and geographical location. These may include a healer who uses bamboo and deep-tissue techniques from Northern Thailand, or practitioners of Master Mantak Chia from Chiang Mai, who practice Chi Nei Tsang, abdominal work. Also Taoist sensual bodywork taught by Stephen Russell, or craniosacral therapists, and a Reiki practitioner from Berlin.</p><p>Esalen Massage anyone? Michael comments, &#8220;What is the point of paying 400 USD for a luxury massage if you have to wear nylon underwear and the therapist asks you stupid questions like &#8216;how is the pressure, Madam?&#8217;&#8221; he questions, highlighting the absurdity of restricting clothing during such an immersive experience. Esalen massage, with its extensive, sweeping movements over the entire body, requires minimal barriers between the practitioner&#8217;s hands and the client&#8217;s skin to maintain the fluidity and effectiveness of the technique.</p><p>Michael questions the conventional spa practice of inquiring about preferred pressure, suggesting that at Esalen, the skilled therapists are trained to intuitively understand the needs of their clients&#8217; bodies. They adjust their techniques in response to subtle cues like breathing patterns and muscle tension, thereby personalizing the experience without the need for disruptive verbal exchanges. He emphatically states that the Esalen therapists he provides rely on their keen observation skills to determine the appropriate level of touch, whether it involves applying firmer pressure or perhaps not touching at all. This intuitive approach allows them to conduct the massage in a way that feels almost telepathically attuned to the client&#8217;s immediate physical and emotional state.</p><p>Another facet of Forbidden Yoga is the ancient rhythms of Kundalini Kriya Yoga. Before the program begins, Michael elucidates that Kundalini Yoga, as it is popularly understood today, deviates significantly from its original essence. In ancient times, such reverence was held for &#8220;HER&#8221; that merely pronouncing the name &#8220;Kundalini&#8221; was done with the utmost respect, aware that &#8220;SHE&#8221; was listening. Michael explains, &#8220;Modern Kundalini Yoga resembles a soap opera compared to its profound origins. We will journey back to discover its true essence.&#8221; He adds poignantly, &#8220;Devotion is not &#8216;God is for me.&#8217; It is &#8216;I am for God.&#8217;&#8221; With a modern model of spirituality, people often come with this attitude: what&#8217;s in it for me? I&#8217;ve paid, so deliver me something profound! Give me something equivalent to what I have paid for! The problem with this attitude is that it makes true change nearly impossible. You have to worship the infinite in whatever manifestation to receive the happiness you are looking for. That is why in the &#8220;Game&#8221; movie with Michael Douglas, all is taken away from the traumatized wealthy main actor so he can understand that behind his snobbishness and arrogance was just a hidden big cloud of sadness, social alienation, and despair.</p><p>He expresses hope that during their time together, he might facilitate an opening for Kundalini Shakti to touch them, though it remains HER choice to do so. The session will involve practicing specific movements, visualizing certain sounds, and engaging in rather uncomfortable Asana breath combinations, which are largely unknown in contemporary practices.</p><p>The group first undertakes Hrdya Dhauti, a heart-cleansing Kriya, followed by the Nitya goddess movement Kriyas. After three hours, exhaustion claims the group. As they lie in Shavasana, Michael introduces &#8220;Shakti Peetha Nyasa,&#8221; guiding them on a journey into the magical hologram of India, back to a time before Yoga Nidra was conceptualized. He later explains that Yoga Nidra was an invention by Swami Satyananda Saraswati and is nothing ancient at all.</p><p>Michael continues, &#8220;Nyasa,&#8221; originating from the Sanskrit language, translates to &#8220;placing,&#8221; &#8220;applying,&#8221; or &#8220;touching.&#8221; However, the significance of Nyasa extends far beyond these simple translations. It involves the conscious act of touching or placing the fingers or hands on sacred points of the body, often performed internally through the power of the mind in many Nyasa practices.</p><p>In Hindu tantric meditations and pujas, the practitioner either physically or mentally touches these sacred points in specific sequences, infusing each location with a special mantra, visualization, or emotion, either spoken aloud or silently envisioned.</p><p>There are various forms of Nyasa. For instance, Matrika Nyasa involves the conscious placement of the fifty letters of the Sanskrit alphabet onto parts of one&#8217;s body, Matrika meaning &#8216;Mother&#8217; in Sanskrit. Another form, Sadanga Nyasa, involves placing mantras into six parts of the body, including the heart, forehead, crown, both eyes, and the palms and backs of both hands.</p><p>Michael explains that the relaxation techniques taught at the end of many yoga classes, known today as &#8220;yoga nidra&#8221; or yogic sleep, originally stemmed from more complex mental Nyasa. In these, practitioners would lie back and mentally &#8220;place&#8221; the sound of a mantra in each part of the body, achieving relaxation, connection, and sanctification simultaneously.</p><p>In the early 1960s, Swami Satyananda Saraswati from the Bihar School of Yoga recognized that the religious overtones of traditional Nyasa might alienate Westerners who could otherwise benefit from yoga. He then created &#8220;yoga nidra,&#8221; combining traditional yogic techniques with Western hypnotic relaxation methods and insights from Herbert Benson&#8217;s seminal work, &#8220;The Relaxation Response.&#8221; Before 1960, what is known today as yoga nidra did not exist; there were only Nyasa and the dream yoga techniques known as &#8220;nidra yoga.&#8221;</p><p>Michael remarks, &#8220;It&#8217;s fascinating how today&#8217;s yoga nidra movement, while popular, doesn&#8217;t open the gates to the ancient hologram. Perhaps its superficiality is intentional, to protect the metaphysical realms from intruders. Every realm of reality has its own bodyguards.&#8221;</p><p>After this intensive three-hour Kundalini Kriya session and an hour-long Nyasa sadhana, only the private clients are privy to a secretive technique called Yogini Nyasa Vishuddha. In this practice, participants project their chakras into outer space as if sitting within brutalist architectural structures on Alpha Centauri, performing their Kriya Mantra pujas not just within the room but atop the 16 petals of the Vishuddha chakra in another realm of reality. &#8220;This,&#8221; Michael reveals to his private client couple, &#8220;is the essence of real Forbidden Yoga. It distinguishes my work from the mainstream wellness industry. I offer my private clients the genuine path, opening doors of perception to realms of absolute subtleties with spiritual practices they won&#8217;t find in any commercial or non-commercial ashram or retreat center in this world.&#8221;</p><p>He discusses the unique needs of high-performance individuals, noting that their brainwaves differ significantly from those of typical yoga practitioners. &#8220;Such minds require complex, almost mathematical meditations to achieve peace. Modern practices, simplified to basics, are insufficient for them; they require intricately designed sadhanas.&#8221;</p><p>Ancient Tantric practice is taught by Michael. He says, &#8220;Ancient Tantra, in stark contrast to the modern &#8216;Namaste-hugging&#8217; Tantra, did not ritualize sexuality but sought to sexualize ritual.&#8221; He jokes about contemporary Tantra workshops, which, while enjoyable with their dancing and eye-gazing, fail to encode the mystical brain patterns of the ancient metaphysical hologram. &#8220;Real Tantra involves elaborate rituals to access realms of timeless bliss, requiring extreme patience and intricate processes akin to navigating a labyrinth of doors, each crafted by gatekeepers over thousands of years.&#8221; Citing neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky for a deeper understanding, he explains, &#8220;We aren&#8217;t here merely for pleasure. We&#8217;re here to understand which pleasures can open or close doors in our mystical consciousness, to open vast spaces within our minds, leading to non-dual states of awareness, and most importantly, to understand why these blissful experiences exist at all.&#8221;</p><p>It is very clear that to experience a retreat with Michael will indeed be transformational, and life-changing. You may take away from it what you will. You will find not only empowerment but also what Michael believes will be a new learning, equipped with practical tools on how to live more positively, happy, and fulfilled.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Michael Perin Wogenburg will be a speaker at SpaChina Wellness Summit 2024.
