This is what the actual medieval Tantric scriptures say, repeatedly, in the bluntest possible terms. A woman initiated into the left-handed Shakta or Kaula traditions carried in her body something men could only access through her: the direct channel to Shakti, the cosmic creative power that built and maintains reality.</p><p>The texts call it kul&#257;m&#7771;ta, &#8220;clan nectar.&#8221; Or yoni-tattva, &#8220;vulval essence.&#8221; Or simply kula, &#8220;the clan&#8221; - meaning the divine lineage that flows through the feminine. A woman didn&#8217;t need to cultivate this. She didn&#8217;t need years of kriya yoga, breath retention, chakra manipulation, or any of the elaborate techniques men used to wake up energies that were dormant in their bodies.</p><p>She was already awake. She just needed to be initiated into knowing what she already had.</p><p><strong>The Biology of Power</strong></p><p>Here&#8217;s what the early Shakta texts understood that got systematically erased by later sanitized versions: a woman&#8217;s menstrual cycle, her fertility, her sexual fluids, even her capacity for childbirth and breastfeeding were not obstacles to spiritual power. They were the power itself, in its rawest, most undiluted form.</p><p>While a male yogi sat on his ass doing pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma for decades trying to move energy up his spine, a woman&#8217;s body was already cycling cosmic forces every month. Her biology was doing what men had to force through technique. The blood, the hormones, the rhythmic death and rebirth in her womb - this was Shakti moving through matter, creating and destroying on a cellular level.</p><p>The left-handed traditions, the v&#257;ma m&#257;rga, recognized this. They didn&#8217;t spiritualize it or make it pretty. They worked with it directly. A woman initiated into these lineages learned to consciously direct what her body was already doing unconsciously. And once she learned that, she became what the texts call a yogin&#299; - not a practitioner trying to gain power, but an embodiment of power that could grant or destroy at will.</p><p><strong>What the Texts Actually Say</strong></p><p>The Brahmay&#257;mala, one of the earliest Kaula Tantras from the 7th-8th century, describes what happens when yogin&#299;s show up: &#8220;highly dangerous, with terrifying forms, impure, angry and lethal.&#8221; If the male practitioner makes a mistake in his ritual, they don&#8217;t correct him. They crush and consume him instantly.</p><p>The Netra Tantra, compiled in 9th century Kashmir, has an entire chapter on demonology that describes yogin&#299;s as beings who are &#8220;exceptionally filthy, violent, merciless, fearless, and mighty. They are injurious to all creatures.&#8221; The Goddess herself, speaking to Shiva in the text, admits these yogin&#299;s possess &#8220;immeasurable power&#8221; - power that even she has to acknowledge.</p><p>But here&#8217;s what matters: these yogin&#299;s aren&#8217;t separate from human women. In the Kaula tradition, the boundary between the supernatural yogin&#299; and the flesh-and-blood woman was deliberately blurred. A woman who practiced these techniques could become a yogin&#299;. Or more accurately, she could recognize that she already was one, that the supposed difference between the human and the divine feminine was just a story told by people who were afraid of what women actually were.</p><p><strong>The Transaction</strong></p><p>In the Kaula gatherings, the mel&#257;pas or &#8220;minglings&#8221; that happened on cremation grounds and at clan-seats on specific lunar nights, male practitioners didn&#8217;t show up to teach women or initiate them or grant them power. They showed up to transact.</p><p>The men offered their semen, their v&#299;rya - the distilled essence of their bodily constituents, cultivated through years of retention practices. This was valuable. But it wasn&#8217;t enough.</p><p>What the men needed, what they came begging for, was what the women carried: the kul&#257;m&#7771;ta, the divine substance in female sexual fluids that contained the actual germ plasm of the Godhead. The texts say that eight great goddesses externalized themselves, then proliferated into sixty-four feminine energies, and these energies were carried in the bodies of women. Not symbolically. Actually.</p><p>When a yogin&#299; chose to give this to a male practitioner instead of devouring him - and devouring was always an option, the texts are very clear about this - she was granting him access to something he could never generate himself. She was the source. He was the recipient. And that arrangement, that fundamental asymmetry of power, was the basis of the entire practice.</p><p><strong>Why She Could Kill</strong></p><p>So why could an initiated woman kill with a snap of her fingers?</p><p>Because she had direct access to the forces that maintain the boundary between life and death. Her body already knew how to create life - every month it prepared for it, and every month it let that possibility die if it wasn&#8217;t used. Creation and destruction, not as philosophical concepts, but as biological realities she lived through in her flesh.</p><p>The techniques she learned in initiation taught her to extend that same power outward. The texts describe yogin&#299;s who could shapeshift, fly, possess people&#8217;s bodies, cast the evil eye through someone&#8217;s shadow, command armies of demons, predict the future, win battles, and yes - kill instantly if they chose to.</p><p>These weren&#8217;t metaphors. The medieval practitioners took this literally. A woman who knew how to direct the energies already moving through her biology could destabilize someone else&#8217;s pr&#257;&#7751;a, the life-force that kept them breathing, just by intention. She didn&#8217;t need elaborate rituals. She didn&#8217;t need weapons. She had something more direct: knowledge of how life-force worked, and a body that was already fluent in its language.</p><p>The &#8220;snap of her fingers&#8221; is almost too slow. An initiated yogin&#299; could decide you were done, and you were done. The texts describe this capability not to glorify violence but to acknowledge the reality of what happens when someone has that level of access to the subtle body and knows how to manipulate it.</p><p><strong>Why Men Were Terrified</strong></p><p>This is why the male-authored texts about yogin&#299;s are soaked in fear even while acknowledging their necessity. The secular literature of medieval India portrayed yogin&#299;s as witches, sorceresses, &#8220;ambiguous, powerful, and dangerous figures that only a heroic male would dare approach.&#8221;</p><p>Only a hero would dare approach. Not because the approach was physically difficult. Because the woman you were approaching might decide you weren&#8217;t worthy of what you were asking for, and then you&#8217;d find out very quickly what it meant to be on the wrong side of someone who could manipulate life-force directly.</p><p>The male practitioners weren&#8217;t trying to defeat yogin&#299;s. They were trying to survive contact with them long enough to receive their grace. The whole elaborate system of offerings, mantras, protection rituals, royal priests invoking Shiva&#8217;s eye - all of it was infrastructure built around the basic problem of how to interact with beings who were more powerful than you and might kill you if you annoyed them.</p><p><strong>What Got Erased</strong></p><p>By the time Tantra got sanitized and exported to the West, this entire understanding had been systematically erased. Women in modern Tantra became the &#8220;sacred feminine,&#8221; the &#8220;divine receptacle,&#8221; the ones who &#8220;hold space&#8221; while men did the real work. The raw, dangerous, life-and-death power that the medieval texts attributed to initiated women got replaced by soft-focus images of women being worshipped, adored, pedestalized - but never actually dangerous.</p><p>But the old texts don&#8217;t lie. They&#8217;re very clear. In the left-handed traditions, in the v&#257;ma m&#257;rga, in the Kaula lineages before they got domesticated, women weren&#8217;t there to be worshipped. They were there because they carried the power men needed and couldn&#8217;t generate themselves. They were the clan nectar, the divine substance, the source.</p><p>And if you approached that source without respect, without understanding, without the proper initiations and protections?</p><p>You&#8217;d find out very quickly why the Brahmay&#257;mala warned that these beings were &#8220;highly dangerous, with terrifying forms.&#8221;</p><p>Not because they were evil. Because they were powerful. And power, when you don&#8217;t know how to work with it properly, kills.&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;</p><p><strong>The Mechanics of Extraction</strong></p><p>But what was actually happening in those cremation ground encounters? What did it mean when the texts said yogin&#299;s &#8220;devoured&#8221; practitioners or &#8220;consumed&#8221; their essence?</p><p>The yogin&#299;s arrived flying, shapeshifting between woman, bird, animal. Their flight was fueled by their normal diet: human and animal flesh. They were predators in the most literal sense, hungry for sustenance. The texts describe them descending from the sky to the clan-seats where male practitioners waited, and that waiting was not casual. It was life-or-death negotiation.</p><p>The male practitioner, the v&#299;ra or siddha, came with an offering: his semen. Not the ordinary sexual fluid of an untrained man, but v&#299;rya - years of retention practice had distilled his entire bodily essence into this concentrated form. Every cell, every breath, every meditation session had condensed into this offering. It was, as David Gordon White&#8217;s research into the original texts reveals, &#8220;the distilled essence of their own bodily constituents.&#8221;</p><p>This was not symbolic. The semen contained the practitioner&#8217;s cultivated pr&#257;&#7751;a, his life-force refined into its most potent form. It was pure vitality, concentrated power, the sum total of his practice offered in physical form. The yogin&#299;, when she consumed this, was feeding on something far more valuable than flesh. The texts explicitly state that the v&#299;rya was &#8220;a more subtle and more powerful energy source&#8221; than meat and blood. It was fuel, but refined. Pure essence.</p><p>And here&#8217;s what made these encounters so dangerous: she had a choice.</p><p>She could accept the offering, consume the practitioner&#8217;s cultivated life-force, and give nothing in return. Just take what she wanted and leave him destroyed, emptied, finished. The texts say yogin&#299;s did this constantly. If the practitioner wasn&#8217;t worthy, if his approach was wrong, if he failed to satisfy the requirements only she understood, she would &#8220;crush and consume him instantly.&#8221;</p><p>The devouring wasn&#8217;t metaphor. It was extraction. She would take his essence, his years of practice, his distilled vitality, and he would be left as a husk. Dead or ruined, either way no longer capable of practice, no longer viable as a human being with functioning pr&#257;&#7751;a.</p><p>Or - and this was the transaction the entire Kaula system was built on - she could give the counter-offering.</p><p>If she chose, if he satisfied whatever criteria she used to judge worthiness, the yogin&#299; would offer her own sexual fluids in exchange. But this wasn&#8217;t equivalent exchange. What flowed from her body wasn&#8217;t just refined vitality. It was kul&#257;m&#7771;ta, the &#8220;clan nectar.&#8221; Yoni-tattva, &#8220;vulval essence.&#8221; The actual germ plasm of the Godhead, the divine substance that no amount of male practice could generate.</p><p>The texts say this contained the power to transform the male practitioner &#8220;reproductively, as it were, into a son of the clan.&#8221; Without consuming her discharge, he could never enter &#8220;the family of the supreme godhead.&#8221; He could cultivate his semen forever, retain and refine it through decades of practice, and never access what her body produced naturally every month.</p><p>That&#8217;s the asymmetry the texts keep returning to. He offers the product of years of cultivation. She offers what her biology already contains: the source itself.</p><p>And if she chose not to give? If she took his offering and gave nothing back? He had no recourse. The yogin&#299; had consumed his power, and now she carried both: his cultivated essence and her inherent divine substance. She flew away stronger. He remained - if he remained at all - depleted.</p><p>This is what it meant when the texts said these gatherings were &#8220;transactional.&#8221; Not in a commercial sense. In a predatory sense. The yogin&#299;s came to feed. Whether they fed and gave something in return, or simply fed and moved on, was entirely their decision. The male practitioner could try to make himself worthy, could perfect his practice, could approach with all the proper ritual protections, and still she might decide he wasn&#8217;t enough.</p><p>The whole apparatus of Kaula practice - the vows, the initiations, the guru lineages, the careful preparation, the protection mantras - all of it existed because men needed something from beings who could destroy them on a whim. The yogin&#299;s weren&#8217;t partners in any egalitarian sense. They were sources of power that had to be approached with the same caution you&#8217;d approach a wild animal that might feed you or might eat you.</p><p>And the women who became yogin&#299;s, who learned to consciously direct these capacities? They inherited that same power. The ability to give or withhold. The ability to receive an offering and decide in real-time whether the person offering deserved anything in return. The ability to consume someone&#8217;s essence and walk away carrying their power inside you.</p><p>That&#8217;s what made them dangerous. Not the capacity for violence, though they had that. But the capacity to extract someone&#8217;s life-work, their cultivated essence, their distilled vitality, and choose whether they lived or died, advanced or degraded, became gods or became nothing.</p><p>The texts call this transaction. The secular literature called it witchcraft. The frightened called it demonic.</p><p>But the practitioners who survived it called it initiation. And they knew, with absolute certainty, that they&#8217;d encountered something that could have destroyed them and chose not to. That restraint, that choice to give rather than just take, was grace.</p><p>And grace, in these traditions, always came from the feminine. Because only the feminine had the choice in the first place. Only she could decide whether the transaction ended in mutual empowerment or total extraction.</p><p>The male practitioner showed up hoping for the former. But the yogin&#299; always, always had the option of the latter. That option, held over every encounter, was the source of her power. Not just that she could kill. That she could choose whether to kill or to transmit.</p><p>And if a man approached without recognizing that she held his life in her hands, if he came with arrogance or assumption or entitlement?</p><p>The texts are very clear about what happened then. She extracted everything, gave nothing, and moved on to the next offering.&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;</p><p>If you affected by feminine Indian magic we can eventually help you out.
