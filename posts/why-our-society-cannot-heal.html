            <p>Society will not heal. Not because the solutions don’t exist. Because society is organized around the very beliefs that make healing impossible.</p>
            <p>As long as you believe in a God, any God, any version of God, you’re locked in. As long as you believe there’s something "out there" to save you or something "inside" you need to find, you’re locked in. Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, atheism, secular humanism, scientific materialism, whatever framework you use to organize reality and decide who’s right and who’s wrong, who’s saved and who’s damned, who’s evolved and who’s primitive. All of it locks you in.</p>
            <p>The problem isn’t which belief system you choose. The problem is believing at all.</p>
            <p>Forbidden Yoga doesn’t come from religion. It comes from a school of thought that wanted something else entirely: not intellectual understanding of the human condition, but actual practices to even out our inefficiencies, our meltdowns, our tantrums. The human mind spins. On a small scale, it destroys relationships. On a large scale, it creates wars.</p>
                        <p><img src="/blog-images/why-our-society-cannot-heal-img-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
            <p>Take one of our pujas, Laghu Puja, the one you see in the video. Imagine going to Gaza and Israel and telling both sides: "Here’s a practice that could create peace. You do it together. Naked. For hours. With breathing patterns that make no sense. Touching each other without agenda. Staring without blinking. No god to fight for. No belief system to defend. Just two bodies learning to stop being at war with themselves and therefore with each other."</p>
            <p>They wouldn’t do it. Of course they wouldn’t.</p>
            <p>Not because it wouldn’t work. Because most of what we offer happens in the nude, and more importantly, happens outside any framework that lets you maintain your rightness, your tribal identity, your story about who you are and why the other is wrong.</p>
            <p>There’s no room in these practices to fight about whose god is real or whose interpretation is correct. The practices bypass all of that. They go straight to the body, the nervous system, the deep unconscious patterns that keep us locked in the same loops regardless of which belief system we’ve decorated them with.</p>
                        <p><img src="/blog-images/why-our-society-cannot-heal-img-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
            <p>That’s why society will never accept what Forbidden Yoga offers, because it works by dismantling the very structures society is built on.</p>
            <p>You can’t have nations without borders. You can’t have religions without beliefs. You can’t have wars without someone being right and someone being wrong. And you can’t maintain any of those structures while doing practices that dissolve the boundary between self and other, that make your carefully constructed identity irrelevant, that treat your beliefs as just more mental fluctuations to be stilled.</p>
            <p>So there will always be only a few. A few people who see through the whole game. Who realize that every belief system, including the one that says there are no belief systems, is just another prison. Who are willing to let go of being right, being saved, being special, being anything at all except a body breathing with another body in a practice that has no god, no salvation, no purpose except returning to what we were before we learned to be at war.</p>
            <p>Maybe you’re one of them. Maybe a few friends. Maybe you find a soul tribe, a handful of people who understand that the emperor has no clothes and never did, that all the frameworks we’ve built to organize reality and fight about it are just elaborate ways of avoiding the simple, terrible, liberating truth: we’re animals who learned to think, and thinking created suffering, and no amount of better thinking will end it.</p>
            <p>Only practice ends it. Not practice that makes you better, more evolved, more spiritual. Practice that drops you so fully into your body, into contact with another body, into breath patterns that bypass your thinking mind, that the whole structure of self versus other, right versus wrong, my god versus your god becomes transparent. Not gone. Transparent. Workable. No longer worth killing for.</p>
            <p>But society can’t do this. Society is the structure. You can’t ask the structure to dissolve itself. You can only dissolve it in yourself, with a few others who see what you see, who are done fighting for beliefs and ready to practice something older and simpler and more radical than any belief system ever invented.</p>
            <p>That’s what Forbidden Yoga is for. Not to change society. To offer a door to the few who are already walking away from the whole bloody mess, looking for something real.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>
