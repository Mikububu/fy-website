        <h3 class="post-subtitle">A Radical (?) Rite of Left-Handed Tantra</h3>

            <p>Facilitating this ritual is brutal. Afterward, I am exhausted for days. Not because I am emotionally drained by participants, I have solved that by using placeholder actors, but because I must sense, track, and subtly correct every energetic thread in the room. I watch like a hawk, not just for inappropriate contact, but for the moment someone's psyche begins to unravel. And I need to know whether they will come through it, or whether I need to pull them out.</p>
            <p><img src="/blog-images/the-animal-puja-img-1.jpg" alt="Animal Puja Ritual"></p>
            <p>Which brings me to this: Paśuvat Pūjā is not for everyone. But I do believe everyone should experience it once in their life. It would work best at a Sensual Liberation Retreat, after two weeks of rigorous practice, or in a special retreat for single people only.</p>
            <p>The structure is precise. The preparation begins with āsana, followed by Nirmanyu Nadī Śuddhi, a breathing and visualization sequence using the vāyu yantra to cleanse the inner winds. Participants then enter śavāsana, where they await the emergence of their inner animal. At the peak of the ritual, everyone plays. They embody, interact, express. But they remain in control. You can defend yourself through hissing, scratching, biting. You always have your boundaries. And at the end, you return to śavāsana, where the voice of the facilitator reminds you: "That was all a dream. Take your human form again."</p>
            <p>You also prepare with a full snāna, a bath or cleansing, and by putting on specific vastra (clothing). This is not street theatre. It is an ancient rite from the night time ashrams of Bengal and Odisha, where no one would dare practice it in daylight. I doubt it is done today anywhere in India. And that is why I recommend watching Cat People, yes, the Bowie film, before attempting it. It shows the tension between the animal body and the human conscience. And maybe, just maybe, this practice offers a key to healing the strangest afflictions of our modern society: not just shame, repression, and jealousy, but all the passive aggressive diseases of unconsensual behavior too.</p>
            <p>I am a dreamer. Perhaps if these practices like Paśuvat Pūjā were embraced at scale, they could do what religions have always failed to do, prevent war. Heal minds. Transform culture.</p>
            <p>But to get there, we still must walk a long, devoured road.</p>
