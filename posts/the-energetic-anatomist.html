Word moves quickly in certain circles because those who work with him often sense that his abilities go far beyond common intuition. He enters the energetic matrix of a person and reads the inner hologram that shows the real structure of relationships, hidden influences and the truth people often hide from themselves. He sees exactly who supports your evolution and who quietly drains you. He recognizes impurities in the system, exposes self deception and reveals the emotional geometry behind every connection. He performs deep cleansing on chakras and channels, in person or at a distance, and many describe feeling suddenly lighter, as if a pressure that had been present for years finally lifted. One of the abilities that surprises people most is his capacity to create protective barriers. When someone sends hostility, intrusive thoughts or even intentional magic, he can seal the field so that these forces cannot enter. In places where magic still circulates he removes it without long rituals, working directly at the point where the intrusion attaches to the system. He sees the layers shamans speak about, the levels where old entities and shadow forms still operate, and he removes these forces quietly. He works quickly, without theatrics, and once the work is complete he steps back, leaving the person with clarity and a clean field.</p><p>To be very clear, Stanislav is not a fortune teller. He does not predict events. What he can do is something more practical. Because he reads the human matrix so precisely he can see what someone carries in their mind and what they intend to do. He understands the inner structure of a person so well that he can sometimes tell what the next step of an enemy would be, what someone plans for or against you, or what a person genuinely feels beneath their surface behaviour. This applies to all kinds of relationships, including professional ones. For example, if a business owner has three candidates with perfect credentials and cannot choose, he can look into the emotional field of each candidate and see who would be most loyal, who would stay, who would cause conflict and who would truly support the company’s direction. The same insight applies to partnerships, friendships and intimate relationships. He sees the real intention behind the mask. People who value clarity, who sense that unseen influences shape their lives, or who want a deeper understanding of the people around them often describe working with him as a turning point. For those who feel a quiet pull toward this kind of precision, Stanislav is available to those who find their way to him.</p><p>text him on IG: thehealerstan or write to love@forbidden-yoga.com</p><img src="/blog-images/energy-transmission-teacher-student-beach.jpg"/ alt="Illustration for The Energetic Anatomist - Tantric yoga and spiritual practice"><img src="/blog-images/tantric-transmission-teaching-scene.jpg"/ alt="Illustration for The Energetic Anatomist - Tantric yoga and spiritual practice"><p></p><p></p>
