            <div><p>What struck me about working with Brazilian placeholder actors was their immediate understanding. Pranayama? They got it instantly. Speech practices? No hesitation. Sensuality? Already in their bodies, no training required.</p><p>This makes sense when you consider what runs through Brazilian culture. Christianity arrived through Portuguese colonization, but it never displaced the African and indigenous traditions that came before. Instead, everything merged. Candomblé and Umbanda survived by syncretizing their orixás with Catholic saints. Trance healing priests operate in the same cultural space as Catholic masses. Animism meets Catholic mysticism without contradiction.</p><p>Brazilians grow up breathing this fusion. Capoeira, which looks like dance but functions as martial art and spiritual practice simultaneously, shares cultural space with devotion to Padre Pio. The body is sacred and sensual at once. Ecstatic states are normal, not exceptional. Spiritual possession happens at ceremonies while Catholic processions move through the streets. None of this creates cognitive dissonance because the culture never separated spirit from flesh, never made transcendence and embodiment opposite poles.</p><p>This is why Brazilian placeholder actors require almost no training in what Forbidden Yoga does. The practices we teach from extinct Tantric lineages ask people to hold spiritual intensity and physical sensuality in the same moment, to experience the body as both material and metaphysical. Brazilians already live there. It’s in their veins.</p><p>Forbidden Yoga needs to work with Brazilians again. Long overdue.</p><p>If you’re interested in booking a retreat with Brazilian placeholder actors, our flying circus is holding new castings in Brazil. New people. We can work anywhere in the world. Returning to Brazil, where our very first project happened, remains possible.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p><p>love@forbidden-yoga.com</p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://tinyurl.com/kv8knh83","text":"watch Video","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><span>watch Video</span></p><p></p></div>
