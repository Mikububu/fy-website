            <p>In this Forbidden Yoga therapy session, Michael introduces a technique titled &quot;Kramarishi Nyasa,&quot; aimed at finding and voicing your true pain, derived from the philosophy of the Indian Advaita Vedanta tradition. This session features Michael stepping into the role of a passive placeholder actor, while Mouna from Germany acts as the active participant. Notably, these two met only a few hours before the workshop commenced, sharing no prior acquaintance.</p>

            <p>Basically, Michael serves as a blank canvas for Mouna's emotions, allowing her to project and process her feelings freely. This approach emphasizes the importance of addressing primary emotions and sensations-those raw, unfiltered experiences that emerge spontaneously through our sensory organs triggered by touch, smell, taste, sight, and sound. Secondary emotions, the narratives and interpretations we create around these primary sensations, such as guilt, shame, and hate, often obscure or dilute the true intensity of our original feelings.</p>
                        <p><img src="/blog-images/reclaiming-your-voice-working-through-img-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
            <p>In the video, Michael and Mouna navigate this process, aiming to pierce through the veil of secondary thoughts to reach the core of true pain. This approach gives emotional release and opens a space where deep-seated, often ignored, forgotten, or suppressed emotions can resurface and be acknowledged in a safe and controlled environment.</p>
            <p>Michael's role as a placeholder actor facilitates this journey, offering Mouna a safe and non-judgmental space to explore and express her intense emotions. This dynamic between the passive and active participants illustrates the potential to heal and transform, bridging ancient practices with contemporary therapeutic needs.</p>
            <p>Would you like to try out this practice with Michael? Are you interested in having him take you on a journey of the irrational? Scream, shout, cry, or violently beat your life story onto the &quot;canvas of his body&quot;? You can schedule a coaching call to have an initial conversation and set up an entire coaching week to practice Kramarishi Nyasa and other methods of self-exploration and emotional healing.</p></div>
