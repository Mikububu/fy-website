You learn to write the beeja mantras of the petals, to pronounce them with precision, and to hold their forms steadily in inner vision while the breath carries them through your body in a specific pranayama. In time, the petals stop being a diagram in a book and become a landscape you can walk in.</p><p>The beeja petals of Muladhara are not a minor technicality. They are the script of how Shakti first condenses into matter, instinct, memory, and survival. To work with these sounds is to work directly with the threshold where animal life, human desire, and the sleeping serpent of Kundalini all share the same ground. When you circulate these beejas with breath and awareness, Muladhara begins to open on a very subtle level, whether your practice includes sexual elements or remains completely non sexual.</p><p>For a Shakta Tantric life never really leaves Muladhara behind. You may explore many chakras and inner spaces, but you return again and again to this root. It is the heart of nature in you. It is the place where you remember that you belong to soil, blood, forest, ocean, bone. We do not glorify mental struggle. We stay close to the earth, even as the earth is wounded by money, greed, and power.</p><p>By going deep into the petal sounds, letting them vibrate in your body day after day, you begin to merge with the simplicity and quiet magic of the natural world around you. The boundary between your nervous system and the wider field of life becomes thinner. At a certain point the inner hearing refines itself and you begin to notice the Nadas, the subtle tones of other realms that were always present, simply drowned out before by noise.</p><p>love@forbidden-yoga.com</p><div class="videoScrollTarget-SzB20Y" data-component-name="VideoEmbedPlayer" id="media-785b7f3d-3fac-4d1a-ba57-cc56e0f3d2c2"><div class="container-ODcHQE videoPlaceholderSilhouette-XopYyA containerAnimated-jVAZvQ"></div></div></div>
