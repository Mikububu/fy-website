        <div class="post-content">
            <div><p></p><h4 class="header-anchor-post">PRE &amp; POST DIVORCE DE-coupling is a variation of Forbidden Yoga’s Sensual Liberation Retreats, designed specifically for couples who have already decided to split or divorce or who need post-divorce solutions. Instead of heading straight to a divorce lawyer, couples are invited to participate in a retreat that offers a magical space to navigate the separation process. As always, Forbidden Yoga retreats are intended to be a wild ride into the irrational realms of our clients' subconsciousness.</h4><hr/><p><em>In the Tantric Mahavidya tradition, which investigates topics of death and sex, Goddess Chinnamasta stands on a copulating couple.</em></p><p><em>Chinnamasta is the 6th of the 10 Mahavidya goddesses, each incarnating a particular aspect of non-dual reality.</em></p><p><em>Food for thought: Is the lovemaking couple imprisoned in the samsaric cycle of lust, desire, and death? Does the imagery underscore Chinnamasta's mastery over primal forces, emphasizing her role as a symbol of transformation and spiritual enlightenment in Hindu mythology?</em></p><p><em>Chinnamasta, whose worship is widespread even in modern India, may also be associated with the rising of Kundalini energy. She operates in Tejas, the element of fire.</em></p><p><em>The squirting blood pouring out of her throat represents the energy channels of Sushumna, Ida, and Pingala Nadis in the spine.</em></p><p><em>This 3D painting was created in 2016 with DAZ 3D by Michael P Wogenburg.</em></p><hr/><p></p><p></p><hr/><p></p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Cognitive, Sensual, and Spiritual De-coupling Exercises</h3><p></p><ul><li><p><span>The couple will experience specific meditations and therapeutic exercises designed to bring the unspoken to the surface. This includes confronting hidden emotions such as hate, repulsion, and buried resentments. By addressing these raw and uncomfortable feelings, we foster open communication and pave the way for authentic emotional release and healing. With sensual, safe, surrogate placeholder actors, the couple will be guided through verbal practice and roleplay. Placeholder actors allow the couple to express </span><strong>chaos without consequence</strong><span>.</span></p><p></p></li><li><p>One particular practice, Matangi Nyasa, leads two people back to the time they met and fell in love. This exercise was invented by ancient sages to help individuals reflect on their time together, learn from the karmic experience, understand why their paths have crossed, and prepare for their next chapter.</p><p></p></li><li><p>The couple will go through intense coaching sessions on effective communication, co-parenting strategies, and managing the logistical aspects of separation. This part of the workshop will be conducted by a spiritually inclined divorce lawyer, ensuring a balanced approach to both practical and emotional challenges.</p><p></p><hr/><p></p><p></p></li></ul><p></p><hr/><p></p><h4 class="header-anchor-post">The overall goal of the program is to create a space for healing, serenity, reflection, and rediscovering mutual respect, ultimately helping couples part amicably and with a sense of closure. This approach can save them from prolonged and costly conflicts, providing a more peaceful and respectful path forward.</h4><h4 class="header-anchor-post"></h4><hr/><p></p><p>As an example of our unique Forbidden Yoga practices, have a look at this video:</p><p></p><hr/><p></p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Embracing the Theme of Death</h3><p></p><p>The entire PRE &amp; POST DIVORCE  De-coupling program is interwoven with the theme of death. Our practices and rituals explore the subject of death, musically supported by a SoundCloud playlist of indigenous death music rituals from around the world.</p><p></p><hr/><p></p><h6>(This amazing video can still be bought as NFT)</h6><h6><code>© Klaus Bo</code></h6><hr/><h6><code>© Klaus Bo</code></h6><hr/><p> </p><h4 class="header-anchor-post">Why Use the Death Theme in a DE-coupling Workshop?</h4><p>Meditating on our own death helps us realize that individual fighting and arguing are not as important as we might think. Many arguments in marriages that lead to divorce are caused by insignificant incidents. These are often not individual mistakes but patterns absorbed from society. By contemplating DEATH, we can peel away layers of ignorance and egoism and view past relationships from a more distant perspective.</p><p>Each DE-coupling workshop is tailor-made, beginning with an extensive analysis of the situation through online meetings.</p><p></p><hr/><p></p><h2 class="header-anchor-post"><strong>Indigenous Funeral Death Ceremonies</strong></h2><h3 class="header-anchor-post">deadandaliveproject.com</h3><p></p><p>For those interested in an even deeper, more immersive experience, the retreat also offers an optional component: observing indigenous funeral death ceremonies. These ceremonies take place in various global locations such as Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Madagascar, and Indonesia. This component is a collaboration with Danish photographer Klaus Bo, creator of the Death and Alive Project. Klaus Bo, along with Michael Wogenburg, will guide these tours. Klaus Bo’s extensive experience traveling the world and investigating these secret sites and family traditions brings a unique depth to this offering.</p><p></p><h6><code>© Klaus Bo</code></h6><p></p><p>By witnessing these rituals, couples can gain a deeper understanding of how different cultures handle death. The humbling nature of confronting mortality can encourage couples to set aside their egos and approach their separation with respect. This optional experience aims to help couples become more aware of their own impermanence, facilitating a more profound and respectful decoupling process.</p></div>
