# Register Your Real WhatsApp Business Number

## Current Situation
- You have: +62 851 902 47022 (used in WhatsApp Business iPhone app)
- Currently using: Meta test number +1 555 004 6562 (has limitations)
- Goal: Use your real number for the bot

## Important Warning ⚠️

**BEFORE YOU START:**
When you register +62 851 902 47022 with Meta WhatsApp Business API, you will:
- ❌ **LOSE access to it on the WhatsApp Business iPhone app**

**This is a one-way migration!** Once you register the number with the API, you can't go back to using it on your phone.

## Alternative: Use a New Number

**Recommended approach:**
1. Get a NEW phone number for the bot
2. Keep +62 851 902 47022 for manual WhatsApp Business app use
3. Register the NEW number with Meta API
4. Update website button to new number

## My Recommendation 💡

**Best approach for your situation:**

### Keep Current Number for Manual Use
Since you're already using +62 851 902 47022 on WhatsApp Business app:

1. **Get a NEW Indonesian number** (SIM card, ~$5-10)
2. **Register the NEW number** with Meta API for the bot
3. **Keep +62 851 902 47022** for your personal WhatsApp Business app use
4. **Update website button** to the new bot number

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Keep manual control of your main number
- ✅ Bot runs on separate number 24/7
- ✅ No risk of losing access to current number
- ✅ Can still manually respond when needed

### OR: Use Current Number (Lose Phone Access)
If you want to use +62 851 902 47022 for the bot:

1. You'll lose access to it on your iPhone
2. All messages will be handled by the bot only
3. You can't manually respond via WhatsApp app anymore
4. All interactions must be via API
